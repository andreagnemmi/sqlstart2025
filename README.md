# sqlstart2025
Slides and demo scripts for my session Monitoring PostgreSQL on premises at SQL Start 2025 in Ancona.
In this repository you can find all the slides of my session as well as all the demo scripts, links and comments to the code.
There is also a recording of the first part of the presentation. Unfortunately I did not restarted to record the session after I interrupted it for the first demo! My fault!
Enjoy and thanks again to all!!
